# Weather Marker Demo
![](../../images/weather_minimal.png)

This is to demonstrate the use of custom markers with a content sourced by external data.

To build the app:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Note that `src/marker-layout/src` is a symlink to the `scr/` folder of this repo.

# Weather Icons
For this demo, we used [Meteocons](https://bas.dev/work/meteocons), an MIT licensed weather icon pack designed by [Bas Milius](https://github.com/basmilius) also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/basmilius/weather-icons).
